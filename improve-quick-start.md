HF token env variable is needed even when an model on the HF platform is not going to be used.

Error message seen:
❌ HF_TOKEN not set; Run: export HF_TOKEN=<your_token>

Only after a valid token was provided did this step pass, and I was able to see this message:

✅ HF_TOKEN validated

(I didn't test with an invalid or dummy HF token)
